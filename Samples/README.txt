To see how the package works, we highly recommend you to take a look at the available sample scenes. 

As this package is distributed as a UPM package, you need to install the samples first. 
You can either follow the steps below, or for a more detailed version, you can also take a look at the documentation website:
https://buildingvolumes.github.io/Unity_Geometry_Sequence_Player/docs/tutorials/samples/

Steps:

1: Open the Package Manager from "Window" -> "Package Manager"
2: Click on "In Project" on the left side of the window, and then select the "Geometry Sequence Player" package. 
3: Click on the "Samples" tab to the right
4: Import the "Sequence Samples". These will now install in your projects Asset Directory in a "Samples" folder. 
5: You can now open the scenes inside to take a look at the examples!
